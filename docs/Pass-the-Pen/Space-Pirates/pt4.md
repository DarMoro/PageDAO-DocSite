title: 'Part 4 - ???'

---

When the CEO wakes up from his flashback, it has infuriated him even more having been dreaming, deep memories of the conflict from all that time ago - the conflict that broke the friendship of him and the captain apart.

He’s more irate than he’s ever been in his life. He pulls together his security forces - starting with his closest crew - his trusted crewmates. He just had his spy, his aid, Trident, become a spy - revealing his true face. He’s sketched. Who else could be a double agent?

He calls together his core crew and he says, “Go activate the bombs!” with spittle.

He’s rigged the mines to blow up, should something like this ever happen. Grand Canyon level impact on Pluto.

But even in his core crew, there’s a spy among them still. The one who’s a spy goes and tells the rebel the CEO has lost it. 

“He’s really lost it, he’s going to blow this all up.”

The word becomes spread, instant evacuation is not a choice.

So, after sending out the core ten guys - he calls together the rest of the whole security forces. They march on the mine. The doors will blow - killing all the miners. They march to the mine, blow the doors. People are panicked, dying, unable to breathe.

It’s tyranny.

There’s a lrate contingent of armed rebels - they’re armed, because they’ve been working secretly as rebels for a long, long time.

Some dialogue is initiated from the rebel forces and the security forces.

“Now, we outweigh you. Lower your weapons.”

Rather than lose the weapons, the CEO just loses his mind.

“How dare you speak like that! You’re slaves! You can’t do this!”

But...it’s too late. Half of his men have already laid down their weapons - they’re only in it for the money, it seems. Their apathy to the work of the CEO becomes the slaves largest strength.

The CEO has nothing left to lose.

“Just kill them!”

A blood bath between the rebels and who is left of the security goes off.

Heat,

Flash,

Disorientation.

The rebels know he has activated the bomb - and there are far more rebels left than security, not to speak over the many deaths from either side that result. Now, the bomb remains to be the immanent threat to everyone inside - as it always was.

The evacuation returns to be the main prerogative.

By the time over half of either side have evacuated, the CEO has found his own escape pod.

The mines,

Blow,

Up.

And the priceless spore, that which this company centralised the distribution of in major part?

Blown up. If the CEO can’t have it, no-one can.

But, alas, one of the rebels has been communicating to the major spore mother. The spirits have been warning him.

And the spore has had a terrible time growing - the Co. have modified it beyond non-artificial production. It has been bleak for this spore overall.

But, a new sample is fertile. 

In the form of an unearthed egg. Could the spore be universalised?

Made natural again?

As for the security that initially dropped their weapons, a question rests: what do they do now?

Diamond Beard is eventually shown the egg. The fertile spore is taken, and as long as its underground, it can blossom across the cosmos again. There is hope.
