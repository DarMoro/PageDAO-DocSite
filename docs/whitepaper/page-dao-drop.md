**Phase 1**
Identify as many sympathetically aligned organizations as possible, meet them, and present the concept.

**Phase 2**
Present this document to said communities to provide full transparency and clarity.

**Phase 3**
Determine which organizations are most fully aligned with long-term goals for the PAGE network.

**Phase 4**
Organizations receive $PAGE grants to dispose of (use) as they please and/or as otherwise agreed upon. 

Options include holding the token, staking, farming, or adding liquidity into an LP for the token in return for liquidity mining rewards to be paid in $PAGE as well as a portion of the poolâ€™s swap fees, or selling for ETH via the PAGE/ETH pool on Uniswap to fund operations or projects.
