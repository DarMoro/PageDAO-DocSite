Liquidity Pools (LPs) provide the first-ever automated market making solution that can be applied to virtually any industry. Books are a natural place to start for the same reasons that Bezos and Amazon started with them back in the 1990s during Web1.0. By creating this infrastructure for books in the Web3.0 age, we will open the door to a future in which all virtual and physical goods and services can be traded, tracked, and accounted for via application-specific blockchain.

### What is a Liquidity Pool (LP)?

A liquidity pool involves assets on blockchain networks being paired against each other to determine the price of exchange between the tokens and distribute them automatically according to the needs of the market. Recently, Osmosis launched on the Cosmos Network via airdrop + inflationary tokenomics. The launch has been a tremendous success, resulting in an early market capitalization of over $300M and an implied diluted valuation in excess of $1B. Users of the DEX are able to exchange $ATOM (which can easily be purchased on any centralized exchange) for any other asset on Osmosis. Having procured a second token by exchanging $ATOM for it, users are able to LP a combination of $ATOM and the second token if they so choose. Thus far, $OSMO pools seem to be doing very well and $OSMO is the primary reward being paid to DEX users, $OSMO stakers, and Osmosis LPers, though PAGE could be added to LP incentives to Osmosis pools in which PAGE is a featured pool token. 

### More Efficiency = More Profit for Creators

To pair this launching/scaling methodology with a blockchain consisting of something as real as NFTBooks people can truly own is perhaps the most lucrative possible investment in the world today. Real-world assets will demonstrate an ability to onboard new participants in excess of any present-day competing solution, and the rapid growth possible here overshadows other potential blockchain use-cases so long as sufficient connectivity to the external liquidity from banking networks and other blockchains such as Ethereum is made available by Osmosis and GravityDEX and the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol.

### Integration of Blockchain With Real World Assets

Existing Public Libraries will be incentivized to participate in the launch of the PAGE ecosystem via financial incentives made possible by DeFi interactions with physical/tangible goods markets. Inflationary incentives tied to real-world assets can be used to restructure asset economies using incentives (see: Regen Network, Pylons, NFT Art movement). Integration with real-world assets such as books and intellectual property will have a tendency to distribute rewards across the network, regardless of geographical boundaries. 

Cryptocurrency incentives will increase interest within the narrow community of those who are able and willing to create and/or curate books for an audience by incentivizing authorship and the uploading of works in the public domain to the blockchain via financial reward payable in PAGE tokens. Scaling the network to contain the 135,000,000+ distinct books that exist today will involve creating an algorithm capable of identifying each distinct book with or without human assistance as well as identifying and implementing incentives and rewards necessary to acquire all of the books.


### LPs as Bookstores and Libraries

Users will be able to create new libraries by assembling collections of NFTBooks and putting up PAGE tokens as collateral into liquidity pools which function as Automated Market Makers for Books--the robot booksellers of the future. Each LP will feature a DAO empowered to set the Target Price for its books. Books can be minted to increase supply, automatically, to maintain the price of the work.

Liquidity can be provided by WIPP or other publishers, community members, collectors, authors, writers, and artists. No one who possesses the correct assets will be turned away by the algorithms, though content which is plagiarized and/or otherwise problematic will be dealt with according to the policy set by the DAO in charge of the collection in which that work has been minted.
